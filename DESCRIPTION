Description: The CAMPAIGNers app ("Climate Campaigners", available in App Store and 
              Google Play Store) is a platform used to engage with citizens and 
              motiviate pro-environmental behavior using a goal-setting network
              and lifestyle challenges. The package allows to access API 
              endpoints that provide data about challenges, user values (questions),
              data (anonymized activities of app users) and weekly assignments 
              (assignment of users to receive prompted challenges). 
              This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 
              research 2020 and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 101003815.
